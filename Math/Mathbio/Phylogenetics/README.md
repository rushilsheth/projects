By formulating a notion of phylogenetic distance, a measure of how evolutionarily distant two groups are, one can classify organisms into a phylogenetic tree that visualizes branching points in history and reveals the relative relationships between groups. In this project, we apply the neighbor joining technique to 1) a simulated dataset created through the Jukes-Cantor and Kimura models of evolution and 2) a HIV sequence dataset obtained from Florida.
