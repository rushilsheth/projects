# Statistics Projects - Machine Learning

## adreport.pdf

In this project, I built a classifier which determines if an image on a website is an advertisement or not. The final model is correct over 95% of the time, while **not** overfitting the model given the 1,558 variables/attributes of each image. 

###ad.data

Data file, which contains the statistics used to build the classifier in adreport.pdf


## predicting-yelp-business.pdf

The overall goal of this project is to find the best model to predict restaurants' business ratings on Yelp.com based on various predictors including user reviews, user information, and business information amongst others. Through feature engineering, NLP, and many other machine learning methods we created our final model.
